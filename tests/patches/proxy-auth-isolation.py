"""
Verify contexts sharing one proxy with different credentials each stay logged in as themselves.

Proxy pools usually hand out one gateway host:port and tell sessions apart by the
username (`user-session-abc123`). Firefox caches proxy logins by host:port alone,
so every browser context shared a single cache entry. Juggler papered over that
by wiping the whole auth cache on each request through such a proxy, and on every
context creation. Under concurrency the wipe landed while another context was
mid-handshake: its retry went out with no Proxy-Authorization, the second 407 was
flagged PREVIOUS_FAILED, Juggler declined to answer it, and the page got the 407.

    ctx0 http://example.com/ 200
    ctx3 http://example.com/ 407      # valid credentials, still refused

proxy-auth-isolation.patch keys proxy cache entries by the context's
userContextId, so contexts no longer share or wipe each other's logins, and
Juggler no longer clears the cache on their behalf.

The proxy here is in-process and answers plain-HTTP requests itself, echoing the
username it was sent, so no network access is needed.

Run against a specific build:
    CAMOUFOX_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/camoufox-bin python tests/patches/proxy-auth-isolation.py
(without the env var it uses the camoufox-managed browser download.)

What PASS means:
    * no request through the shared proxy is refused: no 407 reaches a page
      while contexts load concurrently and new contexts are created mid-flight;
    * every request reaches the proxy carrying its own context's username, never
      another context's;
    * and every context gets at least one request served, so that a hang cannot
      be mistaken for success. Individual navigations that stall with no response
      are otherwise only warned about -- pages stall under concurrency for
      reasons that have nothing to do with a proxy, which is not this patch's to
      answer for.
